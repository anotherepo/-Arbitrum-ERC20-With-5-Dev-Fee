3. In "Solidity Compiler", select 0.8.20
4. Compile
5. Go to "Deploy & Run"
   - Environment: Injected Provider (Metamask)
   - Network: Arbitrum Sepolia or Arbitrum Goerli (testnet)
6. Set constructor params:
   - `_name` (string, e.g. "ArbiFeeToken")
   - `_symbol` (string, e.g. "AFT")

## Testing on Testnet

1. **Fund your wallet** with Arbitrum Sepolia or Arbitrum Goerli ETH ([faucet here](https://faucet.quicknode.com/arbitrum/sepolia))
2. Deploy contract using Remix/Metamask on Arbitrum testnet
3. After deploy:
   - The full supply will be in your wallet
   - Try transferring tokens to another wallet: the dev wallet should receive 5%
   - Try `setDevWallet()` as owner
   - Renounce ownership using `renounceOwnership()` (cannot undo!)
4. Only testnet!  
   After you are confident, deploy to Arbitrum mainnet.

## Security/Notes

- The fee and dev wallet cannot be changed after renouncing ownership.
- This contract is simple and unauditedâ€”use at your own risk!
- Always test on testnet first.

## Example

Deploy with:
- Name: ArbiFeeToken
- Symbol: AFT
- Supply: 1,000,000
- Dev Wallet: your Arbitrum address

**After deployment:**
- Call `transfer()` from your wallet to a friend for 1,000 tokens
- Friend receives 950, dev wallet receives 50
- Try with different wallets!
